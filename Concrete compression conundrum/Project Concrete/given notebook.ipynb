You are part of a project testing the strength of concrete samples. \n","\n","Concrete is the most widely used building material in the world. It is a mix of cement and water with gravel and sand. It can also include other materials like fly ash, blast furnace slag, and additives. \n","\n","The compressive strength of concrete is a function of components and age, so your team is testing different combinations of ingredients at different time intervals. \n","\n","The project leader asked you to find a simple way to estimate strength so that students can predict how a particular sample is expected to perform."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"10dcc269-3659-4851-99cd-f1ffb7f818aa","metadata":{},"source":["## üíæ The data\n","The team has already tested more than a thousand samples
